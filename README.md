## Abstract:
This Project is divided in 3 Phases / Chapters :

In the First chapter the the Robot is designed using the powerful application Solid Works 2023. All of the consideratios, including the robot height, avoiding collision and its width are taken into account.

In the Second chapter we build the robot by assembling its components. Now that the main frame, the foundation of our robots are designed, we move to the next step : studying our components carefully, writing our code.

In the Third chapter a simulation based on the second configuaration which proves the most robust is created based on which the PID varibales are tuned. Formerly we tried to tune the PID based on intuition and guess. Now are model is created and the PID tuner service has come as savior to our hardship.

## Phase/Chapter 1 :
We make use of solid works 2023 to build our model of the robot. We First the plate, as we were able to download the mode of Arduino UNO and L298N -which are used in our project- from grabcad.com we designed our plates measurements based on that. Below there are two Pictures demonstring the measurements of the plate and the holes:
