## Abstract:
This Project is divided in 3 Phases / Chapters :

In the First chapter the the Robot is designed using the powerful application Solid Works 2023. All of the consideratios, including the robot height, avoiding collision and its width are taken into account.

In the Second chapter we build the robot by assembling its components. Now that the main frame, the foundation of our robots are designed, we move to the next step : studying our components carefully, writing our code.
